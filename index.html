              The intersection of live entertainment and social justice
              movements has been around for as long as popular music has
              existed, from Bob Dylan to Bikini Kill protesting through song and
              dance at the Pro-Choice Rally at the National Mall. Over the last
              couple of decades, however, opportunities and spaces for new
              artists to collaborate with social justice movements have
              dwindled, and there have been even fewer spaces that invite fans
              to join these collaborations.

              The first thing you need to check is the freshness of your beans.
              If you have had them for a while there is a good chance they have
              gone stale on you without you realizing it.

              What Is the American Dream? It is the belief that anyone,
              regardless of where they were born or what class they were born
              into, can attain their own version of success in a society where
              upward mobility is possible for everyone. The American Dream is
              achieved through sacrifice, risk-taking, and hard work, rather
              than by chance.

              The Alps, straddling Austria, Germany, and Switzerland, have no
              shortage of places that are likely already on your bucket list—the
              iconic Matterhorn, and the picture-perfect village of Hallstatt.
              There are many other sights that, even if not as well known,
              should be on your must-see list: the Philosopher’s Path in
              Heidelberg, the Chapel Bridge in Lucerne.

              You need those high-energy songs to motivate you at the start,
              hardcore bass-heavy bops to keep your body in a steady rhythm,
              "angry" songs for the excruciatingly difficult moments, and your
              all time faves as a reward during your cool down. Whether you're
              training for a marathon, or just starting to get into the habit of
              running, here's a list of songs that you can add to your playlist.

            <p class="paragraph">
              In this century many places in the south of the UK would be hard
              put to capture such picturesque scenes again because it rarely
              snows, and then melts within hours. Even more striking are the
              occasional archive pictures of hoarfrost. One Victorian picture of
              a local church with the branches and twigs of trees turned white
              by the frost brought back memories of waiting for the school bus.
